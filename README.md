This project is my portfolio, presenting my programming skills, projects I have completed and allowing you to contact me for further work.

#Installation

You don't need to preinstall any packages for the main project - it is written using only html, css and js. However, to see other projects on my Portfolio Page (for example: EduKid Project), you may use some commands of Vite Package to run the local host.

Here is the comand I used to run that specific project.

```bash
npm run dev
```

#Creation process
I put the main effort on creating exactly the internal projects that are in the portfolio, so the main page may look a bit simple. In creating internal projects, I used additional training materials, mainly on learning React.
